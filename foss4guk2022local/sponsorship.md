### Support for crowd funding

[OSGeo:UK](https://uk.osgeo.org/) wants to promote free and open source software for geospatial (FOSS4G) within the UK. You can help by promoting FOSS4G and contributing to the open community within the UK but also by supporting open source projects financially by donating to OSGeo:UK or projects directly. 
We want to encourage others to donate to FOSS4G projects by showing what has been crowdfunded previously as well as which projects are currently looking for funding. 

As a minimum we would like you to include information about what you did / are trying to do, how it did/will benefit the open source community and how people can get involved.

If you would like a project to be included please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/u1a3MER3RrjxoCwY7){:target="_blank"}.


## Sponsorship

We have three sponsorship options for this conference: **Local venue**, **Business supporter** and  **National**.

- logo on the national welcome slide at the beginning of the conference
- a thank you at the local venue 
- ability to have a roll-up banner displayed at the local venue
- table space for a stall at the local venue
- opportunity to distribute swag at the local venue

*This is all subject to agreement of the host organisation and suitable space at the venue. For more details, please contact the local session chair, contact details listed above.* 

**Business supporter** sponsorship helps deliver the event in its entirety. Business supporter sponsorship will give you:
 - logo on the website and listed as a Local Sponsor
 - logo on the national welcome slide at the beginning of the conference

**National** sponsorship allows us to support the overall event, and additional room hire and catering costs for venues where we can't get local sponsorship. National sponsorship will give you:

- your logo on the website
