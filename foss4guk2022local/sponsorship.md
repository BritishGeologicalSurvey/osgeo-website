## Sponsorship

We have three sponsorship options for this conference: **Local venue**, **Business supporter** and  **National**. 

**Local venue** sponsorship helps us pay for room hire and catering at a specific venue. These are key to the success of this conference. Local venue sponsorship will give you:

- logo on the website and listed as a Local Sponsor
- logo on the national welcome slide at the beginning of the conference
- a thank you at the local venue 
- ability to have a roll-up banner displayed at the local venue
- table space for a stall at the local venue
- opportunity to distribute swag at the local venue

*This is all subject to agreement of the host organisation and suitable space at the venue. For more details, please contact the local session chair, contact details listed above.* 

**Business supporter** sponsorship helps deliver the event in its entirety. Business supporter sponsorship will give you:
 - logo on the website and listed as a Local Sponsor
 - logo on the national welcome slide at the beginning of the conference

**National** sponsorship allows us to support the overall event, and additional room hire and catering costs for venues where we can't get local sponsorship. National sponsorship will give you:

- your logo on the website
- a thank you during the national welcome presentation 
- your logo on the welcome and intermission slides of the keynote presentations
