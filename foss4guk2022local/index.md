<img src="images/logo.png" width="300" align="middle">

[OSGeo:UK](https://uk.osgeo.org/) are running a one day FOSS4G event on Thu 17th Nov 2022, on [PostGIS](https://postgisday.rocks/) day. This will be a hybrid conference, but with a twist: there will be no central physical location. We have 9 venues geographically dispersed across the UK, where you can physically meet up to attend the conference. The three keynote presentations and some additional sessions will be streamed to all venues. Additional sessions will be run at each local venue. 

If there is no physical location near you, you could host your own. Venues don’t need to be big - you can meet up with a couple of friends locally if that works for you. If you would like to host an extra venue please let us know. You will also be able to join remotely and view the streamed sessions from wherever you are, if you can’t get to a venue. We will also have a Matrix room to allow people to chat to each other before, during and after the event.
